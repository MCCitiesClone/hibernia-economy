# ChestShops that pay your firm

By default a ChestShop pays the player who built it. If you run a
[business](/docs/guides/setting-up-a-business), you'll usually want the money to go to
the **company** instead — into one of its accounts. This guide shows how, including
splitting different shops across different accounts.

## Find your account's shop code

Every firm account has a short **shop code** that looks like `B:G` — a `B:` prefix and a
short code. List your accounts to find it:

```text
/business account list Acme
```

Each account row shows its ID and its shop code. The code isn't just the account number,
so **copy it exactly** from the list. Pick the account you want this shop to pay into and
note its code.

## Use the code as the shop owner

Build the shop exactly like a [normal one](/docs/guides/chestshop-basics), but on the
**first line** (the owner line), put the account's shop code instead of your name:

```text
B:G            ← line 1: the firm account, not a player
64
100 : 90
DIAMOND
```

The code after `B:` is a short **base-36 code** for the account — *not* the account's
decimal number — so copy it exactly from the list rather than typing the account number.

Now every sale at this shop pays into that firm account, and every purchase is funded
from it.

> [!NOTE]
> You may still see older shops using a `b:<FirmName>` form — lowercase `b:` followed by
> the firm's *name* instead of an account code. These still work (the prefix is matched
> case-insensitively and resolves to the firm's default business account), and the sign
> quietly self-heals to the modern `B:<code>` form. New shops should use the account code.

> [!NOTE]
> To build a shop that belongs to the firm, you need the **CHESTSHOP** permission in
> that firm. By default the firm owner (the **Proprietor**) and the **Supervisor** role
> can build firm shops. Permissions don't stack by seniority — having `ADMIN` or
> `FINANCIAL` does **not** include `CHESTSHOP` — so grant it to any other role explicitly
> with `/business staff role permission add Acme <role> CHESTSHOP`.

## Running shops across several accounts

Because each shop points at a specific account code, you can split your operation
however you like:

- A **Wages** account funding a shop that buys raw materials from players.
- A **Storefront** account collecting sales from your retail shops.
- A **Profit** account you sweep money into.

Create the accounts you need, then put each one's code on the relevant shops:

```text
/business account create Acme Storefront
/business account list Acme            # note the new code, e.g. B:1A
```

```text
B:1A
1
B 250
NETHERITE_INGOT
```

> [!TIP]
> Keep a sign or a note of which account code maps to which purpose — once you have a
> few shops, the codes are easier to mix up than account names.

## Where to go next

- Manage the money those shops collect: **[Business accounts](/docs/guides/business-accounts)**.
- Sign format and commands in full: the **[ChestShop reference](/docs/reference/chestshop)**.
