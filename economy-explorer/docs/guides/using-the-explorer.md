# Using the Economy Explorer

The **Economy Explorer** is the website you're reading this on. It's a live window into
the server economy — balances, firms, the ChestShop market, and how money moves around.
Most of it is open to everyone; a few things about *you specifically* unlock once you
sign in and link your Minecraft account.

## What you can browse without signing in

Plenty is public:

- **Balances and leaderboards** — who holds what, the richest accounts.
- **Firms** — companies, their accounts, and activity.
- **Market** — ChestShop prices, top items, and sales volume.
- **Money flow** and other economy-wide charts.
- **Search** — the search box up top finds accounts, players, firms, and account IDs.

## What signing in unlocks

Your **own** detailed data is private to you — your accounts, your income and spending
over time, and your personal ChestShop activity. To see it, you sign in and link your
in-game identity.

## Step 1 — Sign in

Click **Log in** in the top-right corner. You'll sign in with your account, then land
back on the Explorer. Once you're in, a link to your data appears in the top-right — it
shows your Minecraft name once you've linked (and "My data" until then).

## Step 2 — Link your Minecraft account

Signing in proves who you are on the *website*; linking connects that to your
*in-game* character so the Explorer knows which balances are yours.

1. Open **[Link your account](/link)** (or click **My data** before you're linked —
   it'll send you there).
2. Generate a short **code** on that page.
3. Join the Minecraft server and run this command within **5 minutes**:

```text
/treasuryapi ui link <code>
```

4. Come back and refresh — you're linked.

> [!NOTE]
> The code expires after 5 minutes. If it lapses, just generate a new one and run the
> command again.

## Step 3 — View your data

Once linked, open your data (top-right) to see your personal dashboard:

- Your **total balance** across all your accounts.
- Your **income and spending** over the last 90 days.
- Your top **counterparties** — who you trade with most.

From there, the **ChestShop activity** link opens a separate page breaking down what you
buy and sell, who you trade with, and a 7/30/90-day or all-time window.

> [!TIP]
> Only you can see your private data — linking ties it to your login. Public pages
> (balances, firms, market) stay visible to everyone whether you're signed in or not.

## Exporting data

When you're signed in, tables on the **Market** and **My data** pages show **CSV** and
**JSON** buttons that download what you're looking at. The buttons only appear once you're
logged in.

## Changing the look

Use the sun/moon/monitor button in the header to switch between **light**, **dark**,
and **system** (follow your device) appearance. Your choice is remembered.
