# Setting up a business

A **firm** is your company on the server. Once you create one it gets its own bank
account, can employ other players, and can own ChestShops. This guide takes you from
nothing to a running business with staff and money.

Everything below uses the `/business` command. It also answers to `/firm` and
`/company` if you prefer.

> [!NOTE]
> You can own up to **3 firms** by default. Pick a **single-word** name of letters and
> digits (you can also use `_`, `.`, or `-`) — e.g. `Acme`, `RedStone`, `North_Mining`.
> Spaces and other symbols won't work; they're stripped automatically. The name is 2–32
> characters and **can't start with a digit**.

## Create your firm

```text
/business create Acme
```

That's it — you're now the **proprietor** (owner) of Acme. Creating the firm also:

- sets up five starter **roles** for your staff (Proprietor, Co-Proprietor, Manager,
  Supervisor, Employee), and
- opens a **corporate bank account** for the firm.

Check it any time with:

```text
/business info Acme
```

## Put money in the firm

Your firm starts with an empty account. Move some of your own money into it:

```text
/business deposit Acme 5000
```

See how much the firm is holding:

```text
/business balance Acme
```

> [!TIP]
> `deposit` and `balance` use the firm's **default** account. Once you have more than
> one account (see [below](#using-more-than-one-account)) you can target a specific
> one.

## Hire staff

Hiring is a two-step handshake. You send an offer; the player accepts it.

You (as owner or an ADMIN) send the offer:

```text
/business offer Acme Steve
```

Steve accepts:

```text
/business offer accept Acme
```

> [!WARNING]
> An offer **expires after 5 minutes**. If Steve doesn't accept in time, just send it
> again. You can also pull it back early with `/business offer rescind Acme Steve`.

New hires join on the lowest role, **Employee**. To see who works for you:

```text
/business staff list Acme
```

To let someone go — or to leave a firm yourself:

```text
/business fire Acme Steve     # you remove an employee
/business resign Acme         # you quit a firm you work for
```

## Roles and permissions

Every employee has a **role**, and every role grants a set of **permissions**. Your
firm starts with five roles, from most senior (rank 1) to most junior (rank 5):

| Role | Rank | Default permission | Can do |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Proprietor** | 1 | `ADMIN` | Everything: money, accounts, roles, and staff |
| **Co-Proprietor** | 2 | `ADMIN` | Everything: money, accounts, roles, and staff |
| **Manager** | 3 | `FINANCIAL` | Move the firm's money |
| **Supervisor** | 4 | `CHESTSHOP` | Run the firm's ChestShops |
| **Employee** | 5 | `DEFAULT` | Basic membership — no special powers |

> [!NOTE]
> The **lower** the rank number, the more senior the role — rank 1 sits at the top.
> The firm **owner** can always do everything, regardless of role.

The four permissions a role can hold:

| Permission | What it lets the holder do |
|---|---|
| `ADMIN` | Manage the firm — roles, accounts, hiring and firing (and money) |
| `FINANCIAL` | Move the firm's money — deposit, withdraw, and pay |
| `CHESTSHOP` | Create and use ChestShops that belong to the firm |
| `DEFAULT` | Basic membership only |

Move people up and down the ladder (promote moves toward rank 1):

```text
/business staff promote Acme Steve
/business staff demote Acme Steve
```

Want a custom role — say a "Treasurer" who can handle money but not hire people?
Create it with a rank number, then give it the `FINANCIAL` permission:

```text
/business staff role create Acme Treasurer 3
/business staff role permission add Acme Treasurer FINANCIAL
```

The number (`3`) is the role's rank, used by promote/demote. List your roles and their
permissions any time:

```text
/business staff role list Acme
```

## Pay your staff

Pay a wage straight from a firm account to a player:

```text
/business account pay player Acme <accountId> Steve 1000
```

Find the `<accountId>` with `/business account list Acme` (see next section). Paying
out requires the **FINANCIAL** or **ADMIN** permission (or being the proprietor).

## Using more than one account

Bigger firms often split money across accounts — wages, supplies, profit. List what
you have:

```text
/business account list Acme
```

Each account shows an **ID**, whether it's the default, and a short **shop code**
(you'll use that in the [ChestShop](#connect-a-chestshop-to-your-firm) section).

Create another account and make it the default if you like:

```text
/business account create Acme Wages
/business account setdefault Acme <accountId>
```

Move money in and out of a specific account:

```text
/business account deposit Acme <accountId> 2000
/business account withdraw Acme <accountId> 500
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Members vs. authorizers.** Anyone who can *see* an account is a **member**; anyone
> who can *take money out* is an **authorizer**. Your staff are kept in sync with the
> account automatically based on their role, but you can adjust it by hand:
> ```text
> /business account addauthorizer Acme <accountId> Steve
> ```

## Connect a ChestShop to your firm

A ChestShop normally pays the player who built it. To make a shop pay **your firm**
instead, put the firm account's **shop code** on the top line of the shop sign.

1. Run `/business account list Acme` and note the shop code for the account you want
   (it looks like `B:G` — copy it exactly; it isn't simply the account number).
2. When you build the shop sign, set the **first line** to that code:

```text
B:G
64
100:90
DIAMOND
```

Now every sale routes into that firm account instead of your personal balance. To
build firm shops, an employee needs the **CHESTSHOP** permission — the **Supervisor**
role has it by default, and the firm owner can always build firm shops.

> [!TIP]
> A full walkthrough of ChestShop signs — quantities, buy/sell prices, and admin
> shops — is coming in its own guide.

## Hand the firm to someone else

Selling or passing on the business? Ownership transfers in a confirmed handshake:

```text
/business transfer begin Acme Steve        # you start it (gives you a code)
/business transfer confirm Acme Steve <code>   # you confirm with that code
/business transfer complete Acme Steve     # Steve accepts and becomes owner
```
